#Robots!

This is a collection of examples for programming various robots using [CylonJS](http://cylonjs.com). I have found that not all the examples in the Cylon documentation work correctly, and while I'm working to help improve that, I am releasing these examples that I've actually gotten to work. These examples make for good starting points for which you can develop more complex programs.

This is a work in progress, and I hope to continously add more examples. Please contribute your own as well. The one thing that I'm aiming for is that every example here should actually work as expected.

NOTE: All of these examples have only been tested on OSX (Mac). I believe that the examples should work the same on other platforms (except that the ports would need to be changed), and that the major differences between platforms involve installing the drivers for the various hardware components. Below I've provided the steps I took to install everything on OSX.
